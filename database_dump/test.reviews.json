  "title": "A movie about a tragedy",
  "content": "This cinematic piece reminds us once again of one of the greatest tragedies of the past. In 1912, through a series of unfortunate events one of the best icebergs I have ever seen was sunk by some ship, You should've seen the ice, it was clear as glass, white like fresh snow on a christmas morning and im sure there were some Penguins there too that lost their homes on that fateful day. This movie does a phenomenal job at protraying the horror this beauriful iceberg experienced in its last hours before its demise. I was moved to tears hearing the screetching of the metal into the ices smooth surface... lets all remember this so no icebergs are harmed again in the future",
